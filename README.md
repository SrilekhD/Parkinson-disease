# Parkinson-disease
This project aims at predicting parkinson's disease using the patient's aa-syllable sound.
I used around 100 voice data of both healthy and parkinson patients.
The voice data was converted into spectrogram images and were used to train the deep learning model.
The model uses a pre-trained CNN model (Inception V3) to train the images.
AUC ROC of 0.86 was obtained for the CNN model to predict.
